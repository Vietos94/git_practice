          <h2>At The Playground, we embrace the power of sensory play</h2>

          <p>
            As a mom of 3 with over 10 years of experience in Early Childhood
            Education, I&#39;ve seen how engaging activities ignite creativity
            and nurture a child&#39;s development.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our journey began at home, where I crafted playdough for my first
            son as a way to provide sensory play stimulation during a time of
            months-long lockdown. It quickly became more than just a fun
            activity — it kept him engaged for hours, sparking his imagination,
            fostering calm, and even serving as a therapeutic tool for his
            eczema.
          </p>

          <p>
            Recognizing a need for more sensory play options in Ho Chi Minh
            City, I created The Playground to offer high-quality products that
            seamlessly blend fun and learning.
          </p>

          <p>
            We provide premium sensory bottles, imaginative playdough kits,
            party decor, party favors, and thoughtful gifts for baby showers and
            new arrivals. Our subscription service brings fresh, enriching play
            experiences monthly.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our mission is to nurture young minds with safe, high-quality play
            tools, providing screen-free alternatives that encourage
            exploration, imagination, and growth.

          <h2>How it all began</h2>

          <p>
            Our story is a true boy-mom adventure! As a busy working mom with 2
            under 2 and then 3 under 3, life can be a whirlwind of chaos and
            joy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our journey began at home, during the challenging COVID lockdown,
            when I was determined to create a nurturing and stimulating
            environment for my first son.
          </p>

          <p>
            Building on my background in early childhood education, I knew the
            importance of sensory play in supporting his overall development.
            So, I set out to find creative, screen-free activities that would
            provide both stimulation and excitement.
          </p>

          <p>
            One of my biggest concerns at the time was my son's eczema,
            especially on his hands, which was tough to treat due to constant
            use. I discovered that playdough could be a therapeutic tool and
            began crafting recipes to create a high-quality, skin-friendly
            playdough. My experiments led to our signature playdough, enriched
            with coconut oil, which not only improved his condition but also
            offered endless hours of fun, soothing, bonding playtime.
          </p>

          <p>
            As our family grew, the benefits of sensory play naturally extended
            to my younger sons, nurturing their development in creative and
            calming ways.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our experience with sensory bottles further deepened my
            understanding of sensory play&#39;s impact. For my infants and
            toddlers, these bottles were essential tools for fostering sensory
            awareness and growth. As they grew older, the bottles evolved into
            captivating tools for interactive activities, color mixing, and
            sensory science exploration, enhancing both their learning and
            imaginative play.
          </p>

          <p>
            And then, combining my love for birthday party decor with meaningful
            play experiences, I began creating themed playdough kits. I noticed
            how these kits extended the fun and learning beyond the celebration,
            and sensory bottles became thoughtful gifts for baby showers and new
            arrivals, offering a calming and engaging experience for babies and
            older children alike.
          </p>

          <p>
            Seeing a gap in sensory play offerings in Ho Chi Minh City, I was
            inspired to create solutions that seamlessly blend fun and
            education. At The Playground, my goal is to share these enriching
            experiences with other families by offering tools that nurture
            growth, creativity, and joy in every child&#39;s playtime.
